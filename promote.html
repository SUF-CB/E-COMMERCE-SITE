When customers inputs a search on search such as Google it will output the results in chronological order from the top E-commerce’s to the lowest E-commerce’s. For this process to be carried out there are spiders which are used to move over the web and find webpages in order to give the user the top E-commerce sites. Once these fetches have been done, metatags and HTML tags are combined together which provides the content on the E-commerce page. Both tags are code and therefore, they are hidden from every user.
