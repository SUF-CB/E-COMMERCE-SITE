<h4>Hacking</h4>    
<p>Hacking is essentially having access to unauthorised information and data. A hacker can change elements of the E-commerce webpage as if they are the web designer/developer.</p>
<p>To prevent this from happening the administrator could carry out data encryption which would make the hacker have to decrypt the data in order to use it which would expand the on an E-Commerce website.  Also passwords should be updated and made much tougher so the webpage can verify the actual right user which enables extra protection in averse to the hacker. Finally there is use the use of the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) which gives a certification that supports with security of the website and identification of firewalls. </p>

<h4>Theft of Identity</h4>    
 <p>Theft of identity is stealing personal information of another user. This is usually done by hackers which allows them to use the person data which could be their location, contact number and bank details.</p> 
<p>This is a very severe case as people can take full advantage. Therefore, to prevent his from happening the E-commerce site should change the requirements for passwords. These requirements could be a capital letter, numbers, signs and even 8+ characters long. There should also be a choice where the customer data should remain accessible once transactions are completed. Therefore, an authentication procedure may need to be used rather than a password. </p>

<h4>SSL-(Secure Socket Layer) </h4>
<p>SSL-(Secure Socket Layer) is a protocol that sends data to the internet and it also provides secure communication when the internet is being attained.</p>
<p>In terms of E-commerce the website receives a certificate in order to validate and authenticate the website. This protocol also has strong encryptions which enables the data to become harder to de-encrypt any useful data. Sometimes the security isn’t strong. Therefore, the SSL certificate should be installed via the server as the site will be secure.</p>
