 <h3>Benefits</h3> 
  <hr>

<p>By introducing  E-Commerce to organisations, they will have a good impact because businesses in todays society such as ASOS will available to every user in the world 24/7 which is very useful and beneficial because online shoppers can purchase clothing and accessories at any time which in many cases today is convenient for customers. </p>
<p>In terms of a business view, ASOS will make a profit because their business is extending commercially which will broaden the population of customers.</p>
<h4>Facilities to Search</h4>
<p> Customers can search for the required products from any place in the world and comparisons can be made according to the customer requires which could either be the price, colour and material using alternative E-commerce webpages.</p>
<h4>Storage of customer data </h4>

<h3>Drawbacks </h3>   
<hr>
 <h4>Security Problems</h4>   
<p>When it comes to customers paying for their products on E-commerce websites. There can sometimes be security errors with the E-Commerce. For example, information can be stolen by thief's. This could potentially be name, location and credit car details.</p>
<h4> Delivery issues</h4>
<p>Customer might want they products delivered to them instead of click and collect. Therefore, by choosing to do delivery, customers may have issues with the product size or the time of delivery. For this reason its better for E- Commerce's to introduce more click and collect in their businesses because if there is a fault the product can be refunded on the spot rather than having to wait for your replacement to be delivered. </p>
<h4>Trust of consumer</h4>   
<p>In some cases, E- commerce's can have a lack of trust online due to a lack of security e.g. Credit card fraud and  ID stealing which could lead to a lack of benefits on E- commerce's e.g. Online 24/7 trading. </p>
