<h4>Hacking</h4>    
<p>Hacking is essentially having access to unauthorised information and data. A hacker can change elements of the E-commerce webpage as if they are the web designer/developer. When an E-commerce page has been hacked the website automatically shuts down until security and other information has been updated. For this reason, this is a potential risk because customers will become frustrated as they cannot do their daily online shopping, which could eventually lead to the E-commerce gaining a loss and also the supplier of the organization because for their own searches. Therefore, the promotion would be money wasting which could lead to a risk of shutting down the entire organization. </p>
<h4>Viruses</h4>
<p>Viruses are a piece of  software that is installed to break programs and software on a PC. If there is a virus on a E-Commerce website then this will cause customers concerns  which will lead to customers leaving the organization and then it would also lead to a loss of money. Furthermore, if the E-Commerce goes bankrupt then, the organization will not be able to advertise and promote which would be a huge risk as people will lose interest and eventually forget about the business which will lead to a permeant shutdown. </p>
<h4>Firewalls</h4>   
<p>Firewalls are security systems that controls what goes in and out the system. It is also a barrier which is used to prevent hacking on private networks. Firewalls are very beneficial as it prevents unauthorised access of private networks. However a risk of this is that is can slow down a server. In terms of an E-commerce it can slow down the  E-commerce site which means customers will have to remain patient in order to use the website. This could be a risk because the organization could lose customers.</p>
<h4>Security Problems</h4>  
<p>When it comes to customers paying for their products on E-commerce websites. There can sometimes be security errors with the E-Commerce. For example, information can be stolen by thief's. This could potentially be name, location and credit car details.</p>
<h4>Delivery Issues</h4>   
<p>Customer might want they products delivered to them instead of click and collect. Therefore, by choosing to do delivery, customers may have issues with the product size or the time of delivery. For this reason its better for E- Commerce's to introduce more click and collect in their businesses because if there is a fault the product can be refunded on the spot rather than having to wait for your replacement to be delivered. </p>
